Description
The old process consists of a person (Nora) sending a text message via Whatsapp to all the employees,
the message contains today's menu with the different alternatives for lunch.

Hello!
I share with you today's menu :)

Option 1: Corn pie, Salad and Dessert
Option 2: Chicken Nugget Rice, Salad and Dessert
Option 3: Rice with hamburger, Salad and Dessert
Option 4: Premium chicken Salad and Dessert.

Have a nice day!

With the new system, Nora should be able to:

Create a menu for a specific date.
Send a Slack reminder with today's menu to all employees 
(this process needs to be asynchronous and implemented by using Celery tasks).
The employees should be able to:

Choose their preferred meal (until 11 AM CLT).
Specify customizations (e.g. no tomatoes in the salad).
Nora should be the only user to be able to see what the employees have requested,
and to create and edit today's menu. The employees should be able to specify what they want
for lunch but they shouldn't be able to see what others have requested.

we'll be evaluating, these aspects:

Functionality
Testing
Documentation
Software design
Programming style
Appropriate frameworks use

Aspects to be ignored
